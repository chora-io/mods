## Authority Account

The authority of the network is an account that has permission to update module parameters. Only the current authority account has permission to update the authority account.

The authority account can be any account, i.e. a module account, a group account, a multi-sig account, or an individual user account. For example, the authority account could be a module account managed by a module that implements proof-of-stake, or the authority account could be a group account that defines its own governance processes and as a result implements proof-of-authority.
