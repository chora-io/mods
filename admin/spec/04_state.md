# State

The `admin` module uses the `orm` module as an abstraction layer over the `KVStore` that enables the creation of database tables with primary and secondary keys.

For more information about the `orm` module, see [Cosmos SDK ADR 055: ORM](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/architecture/adr-055-orm).

## Draft Definitions

`Admin` - A singleton table that stores the address of the admin account.

## Proto Definitions

~~The state is defined in the proto files available to view on [Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/chora/admin).~~
