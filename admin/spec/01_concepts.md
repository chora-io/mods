## Admin

The admin is an account that has permission to update module parameters. Only the admin account has permission to update the admin account.

The admin account can be any account, i.e. a module account, a group account, a multi-sig account, or an individual user account. For example, the admin account could be a module account that is managed by another module (e.g. a module that implements an on-chain governance process), or the admin account could be a group account that defines its own governance processes.
