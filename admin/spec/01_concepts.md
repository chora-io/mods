## Admin

The admin is an account with permissions to update module parameters. Only the admin can update the admin, i.e. only the admin account can transfer its permissions to another account.

The admin can be set to any account, i.e. a module account, a group account, a multi-sig account, or an individual user account. For example, the admin can be set to a module account managed by another module that programmatically enforces an on-chain governance process, or the admin can be set to a group account managed by trusted members that enforce their own governance processes.
