## Admin

The admin is the account that has permission to update module parameters. Module parameters define the settings of the module. The same account can be the admin for all modules within an application in which case there would be a single "network admin" (see the [admin](../admin/) module for more information).

## Voucher

A voucher is a voucher that can be issued and updated by the issuer.
