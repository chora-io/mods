          offset is a numeric offset that can be used when key is unavailable.
          It is less efficient than using key. Only one of offset or key should
          be set.
      limit:
        type: string
        format: uint64
        description: >-
          limit is the total number of results to be returned in the result
          page.

          If left empty it will default to a value to be set by each app.
      count_total:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          count_total is set to true  to indicate that the result set should
          include

          a count of the total number of items available for pagination in UIs.

          count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored when
          key

          is set.
      reverse:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          reverse is set to true if results are to be returned in the descending
          order.

      PageRequest is to be embedded in gRPC request messages for efficient
      pagination. Ex:
  cosmos.base.query.v1beta1.PageResponse:
    type: object
    properties:
      next_key:
        type: string
        format: byte
        description: |-
          next_key is the key to be passed to PageRequest.key to
          query the next page most efficiently. It will be empty if
          there are no more results.
      total:
        type: string
        format: uint64
        title: |-
          total is total number of results available if PageRequest.count_total
          was set, its value is undefined otherwise
    description: |-
      PageResponse is to be embedded in gRPC response messages where the
      corresponding request message has used PageRequest.

               repeated Bar results = 1;
               PageResponse page = 2;
