## Admin

The admin is the account that has permission to update module parameters. Module parameters define the settings of the module. The same account can be the admin for all modules within an application in which case there would be a single "network admin" (see the [admin](../admin/) module for more information).

## Content

Content is the on-chain representation of any type of content.
